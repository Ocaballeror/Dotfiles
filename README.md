# dotfiles

This is a simple repo with all the dotfiles I use everyday on my systems.

You're free to see, use, copy and distribute them under the terms of the GPL License v3.0 or later.

An installation script is provided, please refer to it if you want to install any of the dotfiles included here, or run it with '--help' for mor information on its capabilities. It has been tested under bash on Ubuntu, Debian and ArchLinux,  and should be compatible with any decently modern version of it. Compatibility with other shells such as ksh, zsh, dash etc. hasn't been properly tested, and it could have some unexpected behaviour, so run it at your own risk if bash is not available in your system. Nevertheless, the script has been written with compatibility in mind, so at least its syntax should be supported by all these other shells.

Compatibility with OSX shouldn't be expected at all. I don't have a Mac, I don't intend to buy one and VMs for it run terribly slow, so I couldn't even test it if I wanted. Feel free to read any code and adapt it to your system, though.
